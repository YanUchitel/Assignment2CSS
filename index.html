        Ground Control to Major Tom<br />
        Take your protein pills and put your helmet on<br />
        Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six)<br />
        Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three, two)<br />
        Check ignition and may God's love be with you (one, lift off)<br />
        <br />
        This is Ground Control to Major Tom<br />
        You've really made the grade<br />
        And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear<br />
        Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare<br />
        This is Major Tom to Ground Control<br />
        I'm stepping through the door<br />
        And I'm floating in a most peculiar way<br />
        And the stars look very different today<br />
        <br />
        For here<br />
        Am I sitting in a tin can<br />
        Far above the world<br />
        Planet Earth is blue<br />
        And there's nothing I can do<br />
        <br />
        Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles<br />
        I'm feeling very still<br />
        And I think my spaceship knows which way to go<br />
        Tell my wife I love her very much she knows<br />
        Ground Control to Major Tom<br />
        Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong<br />
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?<br />
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?<br />
        Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you-<br />
        <br />
        Here am I floating 'round my tin can<br />
        Far above the moon<br />
        Planet Earth is blue<br />
        And there's nothing I can do<br />
